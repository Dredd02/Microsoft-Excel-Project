Introduction
This project showcases data cleaning, analysis, and visualization processes using Microsoft Excel. The dataset used in this project is related to road accidents. In this projects I provide insights on KPIâ€™s as follows:
Total number of casualties after the accidents.
Total casualties and percentage by different accident severities.
Total casualties by vehicle type, road type, area and light condition.
Monthly trend showing the comparison of casualties for current and previous year.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is from Kaggle. The uploaded file includes the following:
- `accidents.xlsx`: Original dataset
- `cleaned_data.xlsx`: Cleaned dataset
Data Cleaning
Data cleaning involved the following steps:
- Correcting spelling errors
- Creating new columns for analysis

Data Analysis
Data analysis included:
- Descriptive statistics
- Pivot tables
- Filtering and sorting data
The analysis results are documented in the `cleaned_data.xlsx` file.
Visualizations
Several visualizations were created to present the insights from the data analysis:
- Bar charts
- Doughnut charts
- Line graphs

Visualizations can be found in the `cleaned_data.xlsx` file.
Conclusion
The project successfully demonstrates the use of Excel for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. Key findings are; the number of casualties for the current year as compared to the previous year have decrease, most casualties take place urban area and most casualties happen on daylight. Further, most casualties are caused by cars on a single carriageway road.
